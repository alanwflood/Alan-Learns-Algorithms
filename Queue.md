# Queue

- Abstract data type
- FIFO - first in, first out
- Actions are:
  - add - also called enqueue - adds an item to the end of the queue
  - remove - also called dequeue - removes an item from the front of the queue
  - peek - get the item at the front of the queue but don't remove it

You can envision a Queue as an ambsembly line. Thingy comes in at the start, and then comes out the other end along with whatever other things was behind it. To get something behind it you need to get the first X items in order to get the one you want.
