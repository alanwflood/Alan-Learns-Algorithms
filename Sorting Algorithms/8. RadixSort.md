# Radix Sort

Think "Excel spreadsheet sort"

Data must have same radix and width, because of this data must be integers or strings,

Radix = Max possible values, strings -> 26 letters, integer -> largest digit 9
Width = Length of value, "hello" -> width of 5, 2356 -> width of 4

Sort based on each individual digit or letter position.

Start at the rightmost position and use stable sort algorithm at each stage (in this case stable counting sort), so we go by the value with least weight, the rightmost value to the one with most weight, the leftmost value.

## Example run:

Using array:

`[4725, 4586, 1330, 8792, 1594, 5729]`

First we'll sort this array based on the 1's position (Rightmost value)

`[1330, 8792, 1594, 4725, 4586, 5729]`

Next we'll sort this array based on the 10's position (And values sort in place due to the stable sort)

`[4725, 5729, 1330, 4586, 8792, 1594]`

Now 100s

`[1330, 4586, 1594, 4725, 5729, 8792]`

Now 1000s

`[1330, 1594, 4586, 4725, 5729, 8792]`

Boom sorted.
