# Counting Sort

- Makes assumptions about the data
- Doesn't use comparisons
- Counts the occurances of each value
- Only works with non-discrete values (so no for Strings, Floats)
- Values must be within a specific range (You wouldn't use this for negative numbers or numbers &gt; a million)

## The facts

Not an In-place algorithm
O(n + k) Linear time - because we've made assumptions about the data being sorted, as long as k is less than or equal to k, otherwise we're in trouble, n being the numbers, k being the list size to transfer them into
The algorithm can be stable but requires additional steps (Using linked-lists is one way)

Counting sort only works well when the max values in the range to be sorted, matches the amount of values to sort.
(Having an array of values [2, 10000, 100] would mean you'd need a countArray of size 10000 just to sort 3 numbers which is fairly nonperformant)

## So how does it work

with an array of:

`array [4, 10, 8, 3, 4, 2, 7, 2, 2, 9]`

we create another array of the size of the largest element in the array (10)

`countArray [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]`

we go through each number in the original array, bumping how many times it occurs in the position in the count array
so at the end our countArray would look like this

`countArray [ 0, 3, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1 ]`

So that's:
0 - 1
3 - 2
1 - 3
2 - 4
0 - 5
0 - 6
1 - 7
1 - 8
1 - 9
1 - 10

Then we loop the countArray and add those values to the final array

`array [2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

## In Code

```
class CountingSort {
    public static int[] sort(int [] input, int minSortValue, int maxSortVale) {
        // create count array to the size of copyable values
        int[] countArray = new int[(maxSortVale - minSortValue) + 1];

        // populate count array
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
            countArray[input[i] - minSortValue]++;
        }

        // return counted values to create a sorted array
        int j = 0; // index to write to sorted arry
        for (int i = minSortValue; // index to traverse the counted array
             i < maxSortVale; i++) {
            while (countArray[i - minSortValue] > 0) {
                input[j++] = i;
                countArray[i - minSortValue]--;
            }
        }
        return input;
    }
}
```

## Stablising CountingSort

To implement a stable counting sort we reevaluate our counted array:
Using the last array we know that: (With some prefixs to denote uniqueness)

`array [4, 10, 8, 3, 4, >2, 7, -2, £2, 9]`

becomes:

`countArray [ 0, 3, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1 ]`

Instead of using this array, we need to store how many values have a specific value OR LESS.

This means our array becomes this:

`countArray [ 0, 3, 4, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]`

So that's:
0 values with 1 or less
3 values with 2 or less
4 values with 3 or less
6 values with 4 or less
6 values with 5 or less
6 values with 6 or less
7 values with 7 or less
8 values with 8 or less
9 values with 9 or less
10 values with 10 or less

By doing this we can now write back the sorted values in the correct order:

`array [>2, -2, £2, 3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
