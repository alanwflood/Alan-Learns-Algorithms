# Putting everything together

So using what we've learned how do we solve problems in an interview setting?

## 1. Listen

Pay very close attention to any information in the problem description, it's going to need it all for the optimal solution.

## 2. Example

Most examples are small or special cases. Debug the example, why is it special, what happens when you scale up?

## 3. Brute Force it.

Get a brute-force solution done first, working is better than nothing, then optimize

## 4. Optimize

Use BUD -> Bottlenecks, Unnecessary Work, Duplicated Work

Those 3 are reasons your implmentation is poor.

Look for unused info,
Solve it manually on an example, writing pseudo-code as you go.
Solve it incorrectly and then think aboyt why the algorithm fails.

## 5. Walk Through

Now that you have an optimal solution, walk through the approach in detail.

## 6. Implement

DRY out the code, keep it modular, but keep explaining what you're doing.

## 7. Test
